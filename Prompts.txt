GitHub Copilot: To hash a string with SHA-256 in C++ without using OpenSSL, you can use the Crypto++ library. Here's a simple program that reads from stdin and hashes the input with SHA-256. If nothing is received from stdin, the program returns false and exits with status code 1.

First, you need to install the Crypto++ library. You can do this on a Linux machine by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libcrypto++-dev libcrypto++-doc libcrypto++-utils
```

Then, you can use the following C++ code:

```cpp
#include <cryptopp/sha.h>
#include <cryptopp/filters.h>
#include <cryptopp/hex.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string line;
    if (!std::getline(std::cin, line) || line.empty()) {
        return 1;
    }

    CryptoPP::SHA256 hash;
    std::string digest;

    CryptoPP::StringSource s(line, true, 
        new CryptoPP::HashFilter(hash, 
            new CryptoPP::HexEncoder(
                new CryptoPP::StringSink(digest))));

    std::cout << digest << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This program reads a line from stdin, hashes it with SHA-256, and prints the hash in hexadecimal format. If no input is received from stdin, the program returns 1.
